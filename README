just a simple bash script to make compiling and running a C script a single command

usage:
    after the name of the script put in the files you want to be compiled together
    it runs clang to compile then runs the program.


for now it just uses clang to compile and you can technically make it change the name of the output
instead of it doing a.out but youd have to change that in the script

may make it work with gcc and also C++ but for now i made it to make compiling and running my systems programming
class projects faster.
